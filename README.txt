#Bus_Station (JAVA),JavaFX, Solo project,Includes a UML design.
A Bus Station simulation, Where you have three type of users
1. Admin: Which can Create, Delete and Modify trips.
2. Bus Driver: Which can only view the assigned trips for him.
3. Passenger: Can book trips with a lot of options (round, one way trips).
The system has passenger functionality with every passenger having a username and a password to access her/his account.
The file named "CS272_Assignment2Spring2019" contain all the reqirements needed for the project, including design patterns, OOP concepts that must be implemented also some bonus feature.

Bus Station
Objective
 Design a complete object-oriented system.
 Draw a UML Class Diagram.
 Practice on the concept of inheritance and polymorphism.
 Get to know files and exceptions.
 More practice on GUI.
Description
This project is almost a complete simulation for a real-life bus station. First, we have the bus
station itself with a complete set of vehicles like a bus, minibus, limousine, ...etc. Second, there
are the employees who are divided into drivers and managers. Third, the passengers
(customers) who are trying to buy a ticket for a specific trip.A customer can reserve one-way
trip or round trip. Fourth, we have two main types of trips; internal (between cities) and
external (between countries), they differ in price, distance, ...etc. Also, a trip can be nonstop,
one-stop or many stops.
You are required to develop a simulator for such a system in Java using the OO concepts you
have covered in the course till now. However, you also required to be creative and do some
brainstorming with your partner about how a real system works, remember, this is mainly a
design course, soa good use of object-oriented concepts like inheritance, polymorphism,
abstract class, and interfaces will be graded significantly.
You are also required to develop a GUI that should support two modes of operations for two
main actors: passengers and employees.You should work with files too to store the trips
information, passengers’ list for each bus, …etc.
You will be required to deliver a Class Diagram for your work and the detailed division of labor
among the two of you.
